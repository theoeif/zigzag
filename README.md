## zigzag Project
The Zig Zag project is a web application that lets users explore markers on an interactive map. 
- The backend is built with Django 4.2, while the frontend uses the React framework Vite.
- The base maps are vector tiles served by MapTiler. To render those tiles in Leaflet, we use MapLibre GL Leaflet (@maplibre/maplibre-gl-leaflet), a binding that connects MapLibre GL JS to the familiar Leaflet API. This binding was originally developed for Mapbox (mapbox-gl-leaflet) and later migrated to MapLibre after Mapbox changed its license. Finally, leaflet.markercluster is used to group markers efficiently and keep the map readable at different zoom levels.
  
Package used : https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maplibre/maplibre-gl-leaflet.

- The project is almost live and close to production readines : [App Link](https://duckduckgo.com)

export const OPEN_CAGE_API_KEY = "geocoding api OpenCage" (gratuit);
export const OPENCAGE_SEARCH_TOKEN = "Location autosuggest OpenCage" (payant);
export const MAPTILER_API_KEY = "https://cloud.maptiler.com/ vector style" (gratuit);
```

cd FRONTEND/zigzag
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
